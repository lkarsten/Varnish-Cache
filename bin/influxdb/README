InfluxDB export for Varnish Cache
=================================


We should:
1) be able to export VSC counters every second or so. (beware of MTU with many backends)

- influxstat.c

2) ReqAcct for (client) requests matching a filter. Request rate, time spent, so on.

influxlog.c?
how to filter?
